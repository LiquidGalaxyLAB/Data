Using this network, SatNOGS created a database with all the information captured since its creation. We will use this database to get the information we need, since it is open and free. It contains information about the satellites, the data received in the communication, the protocols of transmission accepted and more.\nAn important step to take is configure the slave screens for refreshing, otherwise the logos and the info balloon will not be visible. Follow the steps below to activate it:\n1. With Google Earth opened, press CTRL+ALT+B on the keyboard or click on the VIEW tab on the tab bar and then Sidebar.\n2. Into the Sidebar, expand the KML Sync folder.\n3. Right click on the Solo KML folder and click on Properties.\n4. Go to the Refresh tab and change the Time-Based Refresh to: Periodically | 0hrs | 0mins | 2secs\n- The recommended secs if from 1 to 3 seconds.\n- Click on OK and close the side bar by following the first step.\n\nDone! Remember to do it for all slave screens so all of them will be reactive.\n\nThis project has been started as a Google Summer of Code 2022 project with the Liquid Galaxy Organization, developed by Michel Agarra Barros.\nLleida Liquid Galaxy LAB support: Pau Francino\nLiquid Galaxy Org Director: Andreu Ibañez\nApp released by Alejandro Illán Marcos"

The laser slides application can be best viewed in Tablet devices with a minimum screen size of 8” inches.\nInstructions:\n-- Firstly, in order to use the laser slides application the system should have BEYOND software installed in the system.\n-- On the BEYOND application we must go to the “setting” -> “OSC” -> “OSC settings” and then look up for the IP address such as “192.168.29.219”.\n-- Once we know the IP address, start the laser slides application on a tablet device. We should configure the settings to control the slides in BEYOND software.\n-- Now go to settings in the application enter the IP address and PORT as “8000”, After entering the values in the fields click on the “Save” button, if you see a popup with message “Connection Successful” you are good to go!!.\n-- Now that we have made a successful connection with BEYOND, Go to the “Home” section in the app. Here you can control the slides with various buttons and customize with your desired functionality as well.\n-- The Slides are generally manipulated using OSC commands, which you can assign to each button on “double tapping” on any button.\n-- You can see a popup on your screen by double tapping on any button. The popup has various fields, Here enter the desired button name, and the OSC command such as “0 1” or “0 3” etc. once entered click on save button and the settings will be saved.\n-- The initial digit in the OSC command represents the row number and the second number represents the cell number in that row.\nAll the OSC commands can be found at : OSC command\nUI UX: On the start up of the laser slides application we could see an on-boading page with a quick introduction of the application. In the home page we could see 3 navigation buttons, “Home” directing to the buttons page, “About”button directing to the instructions page and “settings” page which will lead to opening of a bottom sheet to configure the settings of the application. The home page has buttons to manipulate the slides, the buttons are designed to showcase a 3d button press animation. On double tapping on any button it leads to opening of a popup with HERO animation enabling the user to edit the button.\nNote - The Application does not have any user on boarding process such as registration."
